The routes as the server's own OpenAPI document lists them: a route cannot exist without its entry ([ADR 0036](../../adr/0036-the-v1-surface-documents-itself.md)). A running server serves the full document, schemas included, at `/v1/openapi.json` and a browsable page at `/v1/docs/`, both without a key. [The API](../api/index.md) explains each route.
