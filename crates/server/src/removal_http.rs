//! `POST /v1/models/remove` (GitHub #380, spec #374, ADR 0071): a
//! **Removal** of a catalog entry from the models folder — the Server view's
//! Remove — which frees its disk space.
//!
//! It deletes the entry's files under `download.path`, finished or partial,
//! each at its name and its `.part`, and nothing else: a file another entry
//! on disk also lists stays ([`crate::download::command::remove`]). It
//! answers once they are gone, so the entry's `GET /v1/models/catalog` row
//! reads as it now is at the next read.
